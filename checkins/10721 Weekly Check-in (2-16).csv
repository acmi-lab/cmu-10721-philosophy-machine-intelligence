For instance how did the guy with the crystal theory come up with his theory? If we follow the chain back, the original facts that are used as local knowledge must come from somewhere, e.g. from observation of nature? It would be nice to cover this 'base case' of induction  ",2.(I don't know about formal theories of causality) How do formal theories of causality handle philosophical problems like the type Hume raised? ,"3. Are all scientific theories really falsifiable in practice? This seems to work well with non-probabilistic theories like ""if X is true, Y is true"", but for probabilistic statements, it doesn't seem like they can be falsified? "

If these facts are also subject to the problem of ""induction all the way down"", does this mean we can never ascertain the ""scientific truth"" with certainty?","One of the original research goals of ""AI"" was/is to replicate or mimic human intelligence in machines naturally raises questions that are not necessarily falsifiable in practice (such as ""can machines do X"") -- would Popper suggest that these endeavors are not science?","Hume, and many others after him, have described experience as a necessary component of induction. What qualifies as an ""experience""?? "
2/15/2023 17:45:55,Patrick Fernandes,pfernand,"Can the use of Bayesian probability theory be a potential (probabilistic) solution to the problem of induction, by allowing a priori knowledge (in the form of priors) to be updated based on experience?",Is it possible to completely remove convictions from the scientific process (like Popper suggested) or are we bound to assume certain beliefs as true (such as the correctness of measurement devices/observations) in order to make scientific progress?,What is the relationship between the problem of causal discovery and the problem of induction? Does a negative answer to the problem of induction mean that we can’t expect a general solution to the causal discovery problem?
2/15/2023 23:06:14,Michael Feffer,mfeffer@andrew.cmu.edu,"Popper attacks induction in his work but leaves mathematical induction intact. Are there not similar forms of induction that might be admissible in other sciences, such as physics or chemistry? e.g. we know hydrogen and carbon have certain properties because of their valence electrons, so would “induction” based on such properties be appropriate? What might material theory say about this? Moreover, what would Popper say about testable statements that we are not capable of testing (such as ones related to cosmological astrophysics)?",Isn’t Hume’s notion of induction compatible in some sense with Popper’s notion of deduction in that “constant conduction” of cause and effect is necessary for induction while experiments ad infinitum (at least in principle) are required for deduction?,"Provided material theory’s form of induction is “the right one”, and “all induction is local”, is there any hope of general induction? Moreover, what may this imply about AGI (regardless of definition)?"
2/15/2023 23:09:01,Dhananjay Ashok,dhananja@andrew.cmu.edu,"To what extent to non science fields actually rely on inductive logic ""formats"" or ""templates"" when making arguments?","Are there examples of claims that we make as humans which cannot be simply derived by a composition of ""inductive"" and ""deductive"" and other formalized starting points given a non trivial starting point of claims?","Hume states that when given a new object it is impossible to reason about the properties of this object without experience. To what extent is this true if we have general rules for how unseen objects act and this object, while new is well governed by these rules?"
2/16/2023 10:40:04,Conny Knieling,cok22@pitt.edu,Is there any solution to the induction problem that does not require strong metaphysical commitments? Especially those that Hume would like to rule out,"Is ML research falsifiable (in whatever sense one may interpret that) and if it is not, does it make a difference for defending it as a science? Also, I will bring up the whole umbrellaology-thing if we spend too much time talking about demarcation and why collecting data, testing hypotheses, making falsifiable claims is enough to mark something as science.",In what way is Norton solving the problem of induction vs. shifting the focus of its problem? 
2/16/2023 14:29:54,Simran Khanuja,skhanuja@andrew.cmu.edu,"With regards to the material theory: Even if we were to abide by accepting inductive inferences warranted by facts, facts themselves are ever-changing (as briefly touched upon with the weakened hauy's principle). However, one can imagine facts to be established based on previously accepted beliefs / facts through inductive inference. Therefore, wouldn't this theory make factuality intractable?","It feels like with the material theory of induction, we would be severely limiting the scope of inferences, especially over time as we collect evidences against previously accepted beliefs and facts becoming increasingly constrained and contextual. Doesn't this defeat the purpose of wanting to make inductive inferences in the first place? Did we not want to eventually discover universal facts which are most generalisable, using inductive inference?",All of these readings touch upon the validity of generated hypotheses in the face of obtained evidence. A more worthy pursuit might be the design of principles to best formulate the most generalizable hypotheses instead?
